## projectM - The most advanced open-source music visualizer
projectM is an open-source project that reimplements the esteemed [Winamp Milkdrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MilkDrop) by Geiss in a more modern, cross-platform reusable library.

Its purpose in life is to read in audio input and produce mesmerizing visuals, detecting tempo, and rendering advanced equations into a limitless array of user-contributed visualizations.

### Available For
* [Mac OS X iTunes (plugin)](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/releases)
* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psperl.projectM)
* [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/projectm-music-visualizer/id530922227?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)
* [ALSA, Qt, xmms, winamp, jack, pulseaudio](https://sourceforge.net/projects/projectm/files/)

### Presets
The preset files define the visualizations via pixel shaders and Milkdrop-style equations and parameters.
